# AWS Security Workshop

In this workshop we will deploy a simple ethical hacking application that enables users to safely explore vunerabilites. The deployment uses [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) to deploy the [Damn Vunerable Web Application (DVWA)](http://www.dvwa.co.uk/).

The application architecture uses [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [AWS Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) and [Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/).

See the diagram below for a description of the core infrastrure.
